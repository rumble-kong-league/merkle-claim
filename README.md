# Minimal Example of how to construct a Merkle Tree

1. Go to `construct-merkle-tree/` and specify the information to be stored in the leaves of a merkle tree in `index.js`. Run `node index.js` to produce the root of the merkle tree.

2. Go to `src/` and install the Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
   - to deploy, run `brownie run deploy` in the `src` directory
